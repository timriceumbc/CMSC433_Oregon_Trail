Try taking a journey by
covered wagon across 2000
miles of plains, rivers, and
mountains, Try! On the
plains, will you slosh your
oxen through mud and
water-filled ruts or will you
plod through dust six inches
deep?

If for some reason you don't
survive -- your wagon burns,

.Travel
Many kinds of people made the
trip to Oregon.

You may:

  1. Be a banker from Boston
  2. be a carpenter from Ohio
  3. Be a farmer from Illinois
  4. Find out the difference
     between these choices

What is your choice? 
__End

.Diff
Traveling to Oregon isn't easy!
But if you're a banker, you'll
have more money for supplies
and services than a carpenter
or a farmer.

However, the harder you have
to try, the more points you
deserve! Therefore, the
farmer earns the greatest
number of points and the
banker earns the least.

You attend a public meeting held

Oregon fever." You're told:

If you leave too early, there
won't be any grass for your

there will be green grass and
the weather will still be cool.
