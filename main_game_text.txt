.Diff
Traveling to Oregon isn't easy!<br>
But if you're a banker, you'll<br>
have more money for supplies<br>
and services than a carpenter<br>
or a farmer.<br><br>

However, the harder you have<br>
to try, the more points you<br>
deserve! Therefore, the<br>
farmer earns the greatest<br>
number of points and the<br>
banker earns the least.<br><br>
